            Up in the misty heights of the majestic Garhwal Himalayas that adorn
            the magnificent state of Uttarakhand, awaits a rejuvenating
            spiritual experience for the devout. Nestling in the lofty Peaks of
            the great Himalayas, the four most holy temples of India, are well
            known as Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath. Collectively
            called the Char Dham/Chota Char Dham (four pilgrimage centres) of
            Hinduism. Check out the below tags for a quick and refined search.

            which is also well known as Jim Corbett National Park. I am
            wandering and serving Uttarakhand since 2010 and I got the amazing
            people and contacts all around Uttarakhand which makes me an
            astonishing Uttarakhand Tour and Travel / Destination Expert.

                I would love to serve people who know the value of Hospitality,
                Services, and Time-saving. I can make you done at just a single
                tap for anything in Uttarakhand whether it’s Bungee
                Jumping/River Rafting/Camping in Rishikesh, Paragliding in
                Dehradun/Mussoorie/Bhimtal, Jungle Safaris in Corbett/Rajaji
                National Park, Heli services for Kedarnath and Char Dham, or

                  If we talk about the stay options, I have worked with hundreds
                  of hotels in Uttarakhand and now we are left with only the
                  greatest option at every budget scale, anywhere in
                  Uttarakhand. We deal in stays who are polite, humble,
                  responsive and top-rated in their class. I can bring you the
                  real 4* Hotels/Resorts in Uttarakhand at highly competitive
                  prices and trusted by thousands of Uttarakhand Tour and Travel
                  & guest testimonials.

                  Though you can see a lot of taxis outside, not all of them
                  really prepared/trained for long hill journeys with night
                  halts. If you know the truth, most of them like to do just
                  short journeys like pick and drop from A to B. Here my
                  expertise comes with carefully handpicked well-maintained cabs
                  with drivers who are very humble, polite, educated, punctual
                  and helpful throughout the whole Uttarakhand tour and travel
                  services.

                  I can assure you that you can get blindfolded while making the
                  bookings with Devbhumi Tourism, we never compromise with the
                  quality of our Uttarakhand tour packages. We have a 4.7/5
                  Google My Business rating and 5/5 Tripadvisor Ratings based on
                  83 feedbacks and increasing. Originally it’s 5/5 because the
                  lowest ratings are given by the travellers who were never
                  entertained by us or by competitors.

                        tour with Dev bhumi tourisim, frankly speaking it was an
                        awesome and superb tour organised by Lalit ji. Driver
                        satishji given by Lalit ji was also too gud satishji
                        driving was very safe and he also guided at many points
                        where it was needed. Hotels booked by Lalit ji was mind
                        blowing. Hotel at mussoorie sun and snow was the best
                        stay and best hotel in my journey. All rooms had view
                        scene from my rooms. Safari at jim corbett booked by
                        lalitji was also nice and Hotel was also gud. If anyone
                        thinks to go uttarakhand then must do booking at

                        We were planning for Uttarakhand family trip in Dec 2022
                        and looked for travel experts and came across Dev
                        Bhoomi. The existing reviews were amazing and requested
                        for quote. Mr Lalit was very prompt to provide a
                        tailored itinerary based on our need. We requested for
                        specific hotels and also requested for a tempo traveller
                        as we were big in number. His quote was very competitive
                        and we didn't find it over priced. We all decided to
                        choose Dev Bhoomi which was a very good decision. The
                        entire trip was carried out as per planned itinerary. He

            Uttarakhand is steeped in mythology, and almost every hill, river,
            and temple is associated with stories from Hindu epics. One can
            start their journey in the state by exploring Haridwar and
            Rishikesh, two of the holiest cities in India, situated on the banks
            of the sacred Ganges River. Witnessing the evening Ganga Aarti, with
            its myriad lamps reflecting on the river, is a mesmerizing
            experience that leaves an indelible mark on the soul.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just a few hours from Rishikesh, the journey to the Chota Char Dham
            (comprising Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath) begins.
            These four temples, nestled in the Himalayas, hold immense religious
            significance for Hindus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each temple is dedicated to a specific deity and offers a profound
            spiritual experience. Yamunotri, the source of the Yamuna River, is
            a trek through pristine Himalayan landscapes, while Gangotri is
            perched at the origin of the Ganges. Kedarnath, dedicated to Lord
            Shiva, is reached after a challenging trek, and Badrinath, dedicated
            to Lord Vishnu, welcomes pilgrims to its serene abode.
          </p>
          <h2>Spectacular Trekking Adventures</h2>
          <p>
            Uttarakhand is a trekker’s paradise, offering a plethora of trekking
            routes that cater to every level of expertise. One of the most
            famous treks in the state is the Valley of Flowers, a UNESCO World
            Heritage Site. This alpine meadow is a riot of colors during the
            monsoon season, with thousands of species of wildflowers in full
            bloom, and it’s surrounded by snow-capped peaks.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the more adventurous, the Roopkund Trek takes you to the
            mysterious Skeleton Lake, which remains frozen for most of the year.
            The trek offers a unique combination of natural beauty and a
            chilling glimpse into the past, as the lake is said to hold the
            remains of several hundred people who died in an ancient event.
          </p>
          <p>
            A trek to the Milam Glacier takes you to the heart of the Kumaon
            Himalayas, where you’ll pass through picturesque villages, dense
            forests, and, finally, reach the massive glacier. This trek offers a
            deep immersion into the culture of the region, as you meet friendly
            locals and learn about their way of life.
          </p>
          <h2>Wildlife Encounters in the Himalayan Foothills</h2>
          <p>
            Uttarakhand is home to some of India’s most remarkable wildlife, and
            its national parks and sanctuaries offer an opportunity for wildlife
            enthusiasts to observe diverse species in their natural habitat. Jim
            Corbett National Park, one of the oldest and most renowned wildlife
            reserves in the country, is famous for its population of Bengal
            tigers. A jungle safari here might reward you with sightings of
            these magnificent creatures, along with leopards, elephants, and a
            rich avian population.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rajaji National Park, located not far from Haridwar and Rishikesh,
            is a haven for nature lovers. It boasts a variety of wildlife,
            including elephants, leopards, and over 300 species of birds. The
            park is home to the gharial, a critically endangered crocodilian
            species found in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers.
          </p>
          <h2>Hill Stations for Serene Getaways</h2>
          <p>
            Uttarakhand is graced with some of the most picturesque hill
            stations in India. Nainital, also known as the “City of Lakes,” is

          <p>
            Worthy of its surname as Devabhumi or “Land of the Gods”, the state
            of Uttarakhand is located in northern India, dominated by the snowy
            peaks of the Himalayas and dotted with sacred pilgrimage sites.
            Among the surreal beauty of the mountains and the peace of holy
            temples and shrines, travellers can find the true essence of this
            amazing destination. With unique Uttarakhand tour packages, one can
            explore the best sights and experiences the region has to offer.
            <br /><br />
            There are many places to see, including enchanting national parks
            and natural marvels, as well as incredible cultural heritage
            highlights. The Ganges and the Yamuna, two holy rivers for Hindus,
            have their springs in this region and for about a millennium,
            pilgrims have visited Uttarakhand’s holy destinations.
            <br /><br />
            On the other hand, a large area of the state is covered by the
            majestic Himalayas mountains, with enchanting hiking paths, mountain
            climbing adventures, waterfalls, canyons, skiing resorts, hill
            stations, and nature reserves.
            <br /><br />
            The Jim Corbett National Park is the oldest and one of the most
            enchanting in India, a sanctuary for a wide variety of plants and
            animals, including Bengal tigers, leopards, buffalo, elephants, and
            more. Other stunning natural destinations include Yamunotri – the
            source of the Yamuna river, the impressive Yasudhara Falls, the hill
            stations of Nainital, Lansdowne, Almora, Chakrata, Chaukori, and
            many others. All of them are surrounded by the wild beauty of the
            Himalayas ranges.

            seven sacred cities of India.
            <br /><br />
            Uttarakhand is also the best place to access the Chota Char Dham, a
            Hindu spiritual tour that includes four major pilgrimages. The city
            also has beautiful temples that can be visited and hosts the Kumbh
            Mela, a holy event held once every twelve years and gathering
            millions of pilgrims. Another holy destination in this state is the
            town of Rishikesh, another starting point for the Char Dham
            pilgrimage and home to a number of temples. One of the oldest and
            most beautiful cities in India is Dehradun, while in Jageshwar
            travellers can explore some of the over a hundred fascinating
            temples.

          <p>THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE YOU GO ON A UTTARAKHAND TOUR</p>
          <hr />
          <h2>THE UNKNOWN FACTS ABOUT UTTARAKHAND</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Came into existence on 9th November 2000 after splitting up from
            Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand is named after a combination of two words
            where Uttara means North and Khand has the meaning of Land. The
            state comprises two regions which were previously called Kumaon and
            Garhwal. Kumaon was formerly known as Manaskhand and Garhwal which
            as Kedarkhanda and it is worthy to mention that both the regions are
            entirely opposite to each other when it comes to culture, food, way
            of living and linguistics, etc. <br /><br />
            It goes without a saying that each traveler who visits magnificent
