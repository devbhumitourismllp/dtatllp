                              Commencing the odyssey, the pilgrimage unfolds
                              with a visit to Yamunotri, the source of the
                              sacred Yamuna River, where devotees seek the
                              blessings of Goddess Yamuna. From there, the
                              journey Char Dham Yatra From Dehradun winds its
                              way to Gangotri, the origin of the holy Ganges,
                              offering pilgrims an opportunity to immerse in the
                              sanctity of the revered river. The path then
                              ascends to Kedarnath, home to the sacred shrine of
                              Lord Shiva, and concludes at Badrinath, dedicated
                              to Lord Vishnu. As travelers traverse through the
                              breathtaking landscapes and pristine surroundings,
                              the Char Dham Yatra becomes a spiritual quest,
                              fostering a sense of devotion and inner peace.
                              Pilgrims witness not only the architectural
                              marvels of these temples but also the vibrant
                              culture and unwavering faith that define this
                              sacred pilgrimage. From the buzzing streets of
                              Dehradun to the tranquil abodes of the gods, the
                              Char Dham Yatra is an expedition that promises
                              both physical and spiritual elevation.

                              Embarking on the sacred Char Dham Yatra from the
                              picturesque city of Dehradun is not just a
                              pilgrimage but a transformative journey into the
                              heart of spirituality, enveloped by the majestic
                              Himalayas. This divine odyssey covers the revered
                              shrines of Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and
                              Badrinath, each holding a unique significance in

                              annually.

                            <p>
                              Dehradun serves as the ideal gateway to the Char
                              Dham circuit, offering excellent connectivity by
                              road, rail, and air. Its accessibility makes it a
                              strategic starting point, facilitating a smooth
                              transition from the bustling city to the serene
                              abodes of gods. Pilgrims often find Dehradun’s
                              well-developed infrastructure, with a range of
                              hotels, restaurants, and transportation options, a
                              comforting introduction to the spiritual sojourn
                              that lies ahead.

                            <p>
                              Choosing Dehradun as the starting point allows
                              pilgrims to adequately prepare for the journey
                              ahead. Obtaining permits, acquiring necessary
                              travel items, and acclimatizing to the altitude
                              are essential aspects of a successful Char Dham
                              Yatra. Dehradun’s lower altitude provides a
                              favourable environment for acclimatization,
                              reducing the risk of altitude-related issues as
                              pilgrims progress to higher altitudes during the
                              Yatra.

                              Yatra from Dehradun is the flexibility it offers
                              in choosing different routes. Pilgrims can opt for
                              traditional routes or explore alternative paths,
                              each presenting its own set of scenic landscapes,

                              Wake up early and get refreshed. There are two
                              mediums to reach the Kedarnath temple ie by road
                              and by air. Please find the below details for both
                              mediums.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                              By Road: If you are planning to reach the
                              Kedarnath temple by road then your cab will take
                              you to Sonprayag. In the high season (May/June)
                              there is much rush on this road from Guptkashi to
                              Sonprayag which has a distance of 30 km. Sometimes
                              this distance takes more than 03 hours to reach
                              Sonprayag.

                              in close to the Tapt Kund hot springs. In the
                              sixteenth century, the King of Garhwal moved the
                              murti to the present sanctuary. The sanctuary is
                              roughly 50 ft (15 m) tall with a little vault to
                              finish everything, secured with a gold plated
                              rooftop. The veneer is worked of stone, with
                              curved windows. A wide stairway paves the way to a
                              tall angled entryway, which is the primary
                              passageway. The design takes after a Buddhist
                              vihara (sanctuary), with the brilliantly painted
                              veneer likewise more run of the mill of Buddhist
                              sanctuaries. Simply inside is the mandapa, a
                              substantial pillared lobby that prompts the garbha
                              grha, or primary hallowed place zone. The dividers
                              and mainstays of the mandapa are secured with
                              perplexing cutting.

                              Settled in the mountain scopes of the Himalayas,
                              Dehradun is the capital of Uttarakhand. It is a
                              standout amongst the most delightful resorts in
                              the sub mountain tracks of India, known for its
                              picturesque environment. The name Dehradun is an
                              accumulation of two words “dera” which means camp
                              and ” dun” which means valley. Said to be one of
                              the most established urban areas in India, it is
                              trusted that Lord Rama and his sibling did
                              repentance here for slaughtering Ravana, the evil
                              spirit ruler. Amid the seventeenth and eighteenth
                              hundreds of years, Dehradun changed hands a few
                              times: Guru Ram Rai withdrew here from Punjab, the
                              Mughal Governor Najib-ud-Daula possessed it from
                              1757-1770 and the Gorkhas overran it on their
                              westbound extension before surrendering it to the
                              British in 1815.

                              One of the principal religious spots among the
                              four Char Dham journey territories, Gangotri,
                              arranged in Uttarkashi, is firmly identified with
                              Goddess Ganga, the waterway that we know as the
                              Ganges. The historical backdrop of Gangotri goes
                              back to hundreds of years when Goddess Ganga
                              changed herself into a stream to break down the
                              wrongdoings of King Bhagirath’s progenitors,
                              following his atonement. To decrease the effect of
                              her fall, Lord Shiva assembled Ganga into his
                              tangled bolts and has as far back as been related
                              to Goddess Ganga.
